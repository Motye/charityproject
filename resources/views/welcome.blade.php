        <p>Elijah Dimas (HMS Implacable the Sante Fe chapter of The Royal Manticoran Navy, the Official Honor
            Harrington Fan Club) is the RMN's youngest Midshipman. 9 years old, entering 5th grade, Elijah is fond
            of math, science, and especially art. He is an avid fan of science-fiction (especially David Weber's
            Honor Harrington series), Pok√©mon, and the Oakland Raiders. He loves elephants, ventriloquism, jokes,
            the colors green and yellow, and he particularly enjoys helping other children face their own
            challenges.</p>

        <p>Elijah lives his life according the quote "Live Your Life Fearlessly!"</p>

        <p>How profound a quote, when you realize this amazing young man was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma (a rare,
            debilitating bone cancer) at the age of 7 and given only two weeks to live. Here he is, two years later,
            defying the odds and fighting on in a way too few of us could ever hope to emulate.</p>

        <img class="elijah img-responsive" alt="Elijah reading OSB" src="images/elijah.jpg" />
        <p>32 cycles of chemotherapy. 15 surgical procedures. Over 70 tumors at initial diagnosis. In the two weeks
            from when they were all eliminated through aggressive chemotherapy, 9 of them stubbornly returned before
            he could undergo stem cell transplant therapy.</p>

        <p>Elijah Dimas has every reason to be down, depressed, and angry at the world. Instead, he insists on
            visiting hospitals the very place he should reasonably hate! during the holidays to cheer up other
            children! He is always smiling, always positive, and goes out of his way to make his own challenges
            easier on his family, friends, and supporters. He wants to live, and he wants to dedicate his life to
            helping others as a child life specialist.</p>

        <p>Elijah is a hero to everyone who knows him, and he's been fully adopted by the crew of HMS Implacable and
            the entire global community that is the Royal Manticoran Navy. His is the example we all strive to
            emulate, and now we want to step up and aid him and his family in every way we can.</p>

        <p>None are more dedicated to this than the grand author of the Honor Harrington series himself, David
            Weber. David has very kindly offered up a slot on his highly coveted First Readers List to the highest
            bidder of this special auction.</p>

        <p>This is an exclusive, closed list of individuals who receive advanced copies of David's manuscripts at
            the same time they are sent to the publisher, and long before anyone else ever gets to see the work.
            First readers see the work before any copy edit, giving them a chance to read it before anyone else and
            to see how the editing process can change between submission and final printing.</p>

        <p>The highest bidder for this charitable auction will be helping to defray the enormous expenses faced by
            Elijah's family as they continue to struggle day-to-day to make ends meet while taking care of their
            son. His treatments take him across the country, with frequent trips to Denver's Children's Hospital and
            as far as the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. These trips and all the attendant costs are a severe hardship
            for these exceptional people; Elijah's mother, Patricia, quit her job to care for him full time, and his
            father, Anthony, works hard to support the whole family (often missing the trips in order to keep the
            core income flowing).</p>

        <p>This is your chance to join a highly exclusive club and be among the very privileged few who get to see
            the works of David Weber long before anyone else.</p>

        <p>It's also your opportunity to stand with a true hero, young of age and small of stature, but a giant of
            spirit and bravery who inspires us all.</p>

        <p>If you would like to help with Elijah's medical bills, his family has setup a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/mfvjfppg">GoFundMe</a> page where you can donate.</p>

        <p>Thank you.</p>
